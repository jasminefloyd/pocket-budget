# QA Report

## Summary
- Executed `npm run lint` after configuring ESLint to validate React components and project structure.
- Performed `npm run build` to ensure the production bundle compiles without errors.
- Manually verified that the UI falls back to the login screen when Supabase profile requests time out by simulating an offline Supabase instance.

## Details
| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` | ✅ Completed successfully after adding lint configuration and addressing reported issues. |
| `npm run build` | ✅ Build succeeded (Vite) with expected sourcemap warnings about source locations. |

## Manual QA
- Disable network requests to Supabase (e.g., via browser devtools or intercepting requests) and load the app.
- Observe that after the session check, the spinner is replaced with the login screen and a console warning indicates the profile request timed out.

All checks pass, indicating the application is in a working state based on linting and build verification.
